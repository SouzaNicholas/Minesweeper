Minesweeper Synopsis

The project creates an entire Minesweeper board and cover it with hand-drawn tiles.
Upon the game's end, a pop-up menu asks the user to play again. This includes clicking a mine or
revealing all safe tiles. I had tried to include a feature that would allow the player to place
"flags" on tiles they knew were mines, but this conflicted with the tile revealing feature.

To test the project, simply run Minesweeper.java and play the game.
